@article{Holland1986,
	Abstract = {Problems involving causal inference have dogged at the heels of statistics since its earliest days. Correlation does not imply causation, and yet causal conclusions drawn from a carefully designed experiment are often valid. What can a statistical model say about causation? This question is addressed by using a particular model for causal inference (Holland and Rubin 1983; Rubin 1974) to critique the discussions of other writers on causation and causal inference. These include selected philosophers, medical researchers, statisticians, econometricians, and proponents of causal modeling.},

@article{HelmreichPruzek2009,
	Abstract = {Propensity score analysis is a technique for adjusting for selection bias in observational data. Estimated propensity scores (probability of treatment given observed covariates) are used for stratification of observations. Within strata covariates should be more balanced between the two treatments than without the stratification. PSAgraphics is an R package that provides flexible graphical tools to assess within strata balance between treatment groups, as well as how covariate distributions differ across strata. Additional graphical tools facilitate estimation of treatment effects having adjusted for covariate differences. Several new and conventional numerical measures of balance are also provided.},
